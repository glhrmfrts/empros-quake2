- Shotgun
- Secret: Machinegun

### Monsters

- Soldiers
- Enforcers
- A single creepy Parasite
- Berserk
- Flyers

### Sequence

Player starts in a big open area, their spaceshuttle just crashed.
They see the exit (a lift) blocked by a red force field, and another force field at the opposite side blocks the generator that powers them.
They need to roam a bit around to find a button for a door to open and enter the facility.
The next room is a moderately large storage area with a big gap separating 2 sides.
A big crate is suspended in a lift in the center of the room.
This big crate is how the player will get to the other side.
The player must drop down to find a way around and into the control room.
The player will then traverse to the other side where they will enter into another computer room with a single enemy.
They reach a little "cargo road" with a security room on the other side and a vehicle in the middle.
Inside the security room there's a Quake 2 "parasite" monster which is eating the remains of a dead marine.
Right before the security room there's a shotgun for the player to kill the parasite.
After killing the parasite, the player enters the security room and goes into a destructible vent, because it's the only way out.
The player then reaches a lower room beneath the cargo road.
This lower room is actually a garage that leads to a big storage area full of other garages.
The garage right in front of the player is blocked by some crates.
The player explores the big storage area and reaches a upper level with a control button.
This button drops down a explosive barrel to the blocked area, and the player can push this barrel to jump over the blocking crates.
This garage leads to a ventilation room with a ceiling fan casting shadows on the ground, a ladder that goes up one floor, and a single enemy.
This ventilation shaft goes to the red force field generator room, which the player has to destroy.
After destroying the generator, the player is back in the start area and new enemies have spawned.
The player doesn't have to kill all the enemies to proceed to the exit.

The player can explore the train tracks but there's nothing too interesting, just a hidden parasite and some grenades.
The player can see a door in the center but it needs the red key.
The red key is inside one of the control rooms near a dead body.
And the opposite control room has a Shotgun.
After opening the red door the player can take a ladder which goes to the train tracks "maintenance" tunnels.
In this tunnels there are a lot of computer screens and monitors and some parasites and brains, the player needs to use the grenades to effectively deal with them.
One side of the tunnel is blocked by Steam, the player has to get around it by going to the other side.
